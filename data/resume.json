        "Modernized Pointman's legacy application by systematically rewriting critical parts of it to be more resilient, faster & easier to maintain, resulting in a more stable user experience with reduced bugs.",
        "Ran overnight releases every other week, which involved setting up deployment plans, running large scale DB migrations, coordinating with multiple teams and communicating efficiently.",
        "Became proficient in context switching between multiple applications built on different stacks like CosmosDB - Node.js - AngularJS, SQL Server - ASP.NET - AngularJS/Vue.js."
